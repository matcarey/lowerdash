Lower Dash
====

A lower level implementation of lodash.

Why?
---

I'm exploring how node & C++ connect together, I'm using the idea of "replacing lodash (or underscore) with C++" as a programming excercise, then performance testing as I go.  If I find some benefit to the community along the way I'll share it but I expect it will be a learning experience which is then thrown away.

Why's it such crap C++?
---

This is my playground to learn C++, if you want to point things out which could be improved feel free to use the issues but generally I'm considering this my private space (in a public repo because it's free and I can link to)
